# WP Rocket | Disable Page Cache

<br>By default, this helper plugin disables cache for all pages while allowing WP Rocket's other optimizations to still be applied.

However, it can also be configured to disable either cache only or cache & optimizations just for specific pages. To do this, change the `disable_cache_for_all` value to false.

Then adjust the remaining configurations using the `disable_cache_only` or `disable_cache_and_opts` options, depending on what you need to do. There are notes in the helper plugin explaining how to use each option.

Leave all configurations you're not using commented out.
