# WP Rocket | Export WP Rocket Settings
<br>

### Why Would This Helper Plugin Might Be Needed

The WP Rocket plugin settings page provides a standard option to export your WP Rocket settings and saved as a file. However, there are some rare cases where WP Rocket cannot remain activated (temporary fatal errors or conflicts with other plugins, for example).

If WP Rocket is not activated, that means the WP Rocket plugin settings page is also not accessible, so this helper plugin provides an alternate method to export your WP Rocket settings.

### How to Use

Once installed and activated, this helper automatically creates a sub-menu item called <code>Export WP Rocket Settings</code> under the WordPress <code>Tools</code> menu item:

That will load a page where you'll see a button to <code>Download WP Rocket Settings</code>, which will initiate the file download containing your exported WP Rocket settings.

It's probably best to not leave this helper plugin installed permanently. Remove it once you've been able to export your WP Rocket plugin settings.
