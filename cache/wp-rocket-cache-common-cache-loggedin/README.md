# WP Rocket | Common Cache For Logged-in Users

<br>

Use a common cache for all logged-in users instead of creating a user specific cache.

Notes:
* Logged out users will have a different cache.
* This helper will not do anything if WP Rocket's User Cache is not enabled.

<br>

To be used with:
* Any setup where you want all logged in users to use the same cache.
